* Installation

Currently tested on Ubuntu 14.04 using SBCL.

You'll need SBCL, Quicklisp, xdotool, and cl-serial to get started. The first three are installable using apt-get, and cl-serial is available here: https://github.com/shamazmazum/cl-serial

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install sbcl cl-quicklisp xdotool
#+END_SRC

To set up the Arduino you'll need the Arduino IDE, or your preferred method of flashing.
